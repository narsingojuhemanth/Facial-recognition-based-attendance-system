# Facial-recognition-based-attendance-system
To maintain the attendance record with day to day activities is a challenging task. The conventional method of calling name of each student is time consuming and there is always a chance of proxy attendance. The following system is based on face recognition to maintain the attendance record of students. The daily attendance of students is recorded subject wise which is stored already by the administrator. As the time for corresponding subject arrives the system automatically starts taking snaps and then apply face detection and recognition technique to the given image and the recognize students are marked as present and their attendance update with corresponding time and subject id. We have used deep learning techniques to develop this system, histogram of oriented gradient method is used to detect faces in images and deep learning method is used to compute and compare feature facial of students to recognize them. Our system is capable to identify multiple faces in real time.
